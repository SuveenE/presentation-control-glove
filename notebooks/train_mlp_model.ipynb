        "*   The MLP model architecture (84 input features, followed by dense layers with 64 and 32 neurons, and an 8-neuron output layer) was successfully recreated.\n",
        "*   Weights and biases for all Dense layers (`dense_64`, `dense_32`, `logits`) were loaded successfully from their respective `.npy` files.\n",
        "*   The `scaler.pkl` file was successfully loaded using `joblib`.\n",
        "*   A sample input feature vector was scaled using the loaded `scaler`. The reconstructed model then predicted the label index 7, which corresponds to the raw label 7 and the friendly label \"GRASP\".\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The successful reconstruction and prediction confirm that the saved model components (weights and scaler) are intact and functional, allowing for deployment or further testing.\n",
        "*   The reconstructed model can now be integrated into an application for inference, enabling real-time classification of new data.\n"
